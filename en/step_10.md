## Build your game for the web!

If you completed the Intermediate Sushi Cards then you already learned how to build your game into an `.exe` file. Now you will learn how to build your project for **WebGL**. This will allow you to put your game on your website!

+ You will need to have downloaded the WebGL package for Unity (instructions on the first card).

+ Go to (**File > Build Settings**) and select **WebGL** from the list of platforms. Now click **Build**.

+ A folder selector will show up. Create a new file and select it to save the build in.

+ This will take a while! It might look like its stuck, but just wait until it's finished.

+ Now if you go to the folder you created earlier and open it, there will be an `index.html` file. Open the file and your game should load in an internet browser!
