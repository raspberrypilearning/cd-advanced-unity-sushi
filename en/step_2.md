## What you will need

### Hardware

+ List hardware here, or delete section.

### Software

+ Unity

### Additional Resources

+ I provided some code for this that you've already learned in previous tutorials. You can read through the comments in the code if you want to understand what it is doing!

+ Anywhere you need to add code look for a line comment that looks like this: `/*####################################################################*/`.  

+ After you are done making your game, you will have the option to build it with WebGL. Downloading Unity's WebGL package in advance will save you time. To do this go to (**File > Build Settings**) in Unity and select **WebGL** from the **Platform** list. Now, click the **Open Download Page** button on the right of the **Platform** list. (**Do not try to build it just yet though!**)
